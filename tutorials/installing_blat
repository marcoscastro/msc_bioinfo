Tutorial Installing BLAT - Author: Marcos Castro

Download on: https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~kent/src/

Download of file blatSrc35.zip. What we will do is compile the code. I will do this as root, then open a terminal and give the following command:

sudo su

Type your password and hit enter. Create a directory called blat on /usr/local/src with the following command:

mkdir /usr/local/src/blat

Unzip the file blatSrc35.zip in /usr/local/src/blat

To build the BLAT, you need to set the MACHTYPE variable for that the sources of BLAT to know what the type machine that you is compiling the software.

In the most machines derived of unix, type: echo $MACHTYPE

This will serve to return the type architecture of the your machine. In the mina appears:

x86_64-pc-linux-gnu

But the BLAT need of a "short value" that is the first part of MACHTYPE. To fix this, give the commands in terminal:

MACHTYPE=x86_64

export MACHTYPE

now type: echo $MACHTYPE

will show this: x86_64

now create the directory /lib/$MACHTYPE with the following command:

mkdir /lib/$MACHTYPE

The BLAT assumes that you is compiling as non-root user. Enter in blatSrc directory and then enter in inc directory. Open the file common.mk:

nano common.mk

Search for the line: BINDIR = ${HOME}/bin/${MACHTYPE}

Modify for this: BINDIR = /usr/local/bin

Back to the directory blatSrc e run the command: make

After compile, the executables will be in /usr/local/bin

To use the BLAT, run the command: blat

Will be shown instructions to use the BLAT.
